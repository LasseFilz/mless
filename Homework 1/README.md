Homework 1

The file **CNN_classifier_on_remote_sensing_image.ipynb** contains all the solutions for homework one, the ResNet, ROC Curves and Kappas. I modified the template CNN version and just replaced the normal CNN with Resnet, added kappas and plotted ROC Curves. As such most of the file is equivalent to the template.
